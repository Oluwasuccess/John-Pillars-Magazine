            <br>Event decoration is the act of creating a better outlook for a place and the process of beautification in order to make an event memorable<brThis>.
            <br>Imagine a place with beautiful people but in a disorganized and ugly background, any records or memory kept of that place will bring about sad memories; this is where events decoration come to play, which is to give people beautiful memories of their event. <brThis>
            
            <br>John pillars innovation institute has really been a great time and opportunity to meet new people from different mindset background and experiences.
            <br>Students that have participated does far in events decoration I have been learning with a great speed and I've been able to carry out beautiful designs on their own. <brThis>
            <br>Event decoration is easy but cannot be done without learning. <brThis> 
    </p>
        
        <p>
            <br>Though the teaching and learning process has not been very easy but students have been really learning at a fast pace. <brThis>
            <br>Leaving a trademark on the venue used for our trainings has been our custom and we have always created a memorable graduation party for students and tutors through our decorations. <brThis>

            <br><span>Encouragements:</span><brThis>
            <br>I will encourage young people out there to embrace vocational training on a platter of gold. Man should not be dependent on a source of income and no job is small but all it takes is a great mindset.<brThis>
