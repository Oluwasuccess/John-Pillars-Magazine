    <p><br>We preserve the important event and people in our lives. The ceremonies of birth and birthdays marriages and anniversaries, holidays and new houses are all recorded because they matter. It is a personal story, a timeline in our last field with faces and places that we love.<brThis>
        <br>Photography is a language, though complex but our work expresses joy and sorrow, wonder and sympathy, every human emotion can find a place in photography. <brThis>
        <br>Photography is more than a documentation process; it is an art form and should be treated with such reverence as it requires some level of skill and creativity. <brThis>
        <br>JPI Vocational Institute has produced professional photographers over the last one year, that have been able to apply what they've learnt so far during events organized by the institute. <brThis>
        <br>There have also emerged students who has gone ahead to train others with the same skill and are making impact in the field. <brThis></p>
        
        <p><br><span>Encouragement:</span><brThis>
        <br>To every young person or old out there who will like to make this field a profession, it is a beautiful field with a lot of opportunities that can be jumped at, because every great event needs to be documented and can only be done through the art of professional photography. <brThis>
